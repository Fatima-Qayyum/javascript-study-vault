/*--------------------------------------------What is the Call Stack in JavaScript?-------------------------------
The Call Stack in JavaScript is a data structure used to keep track of function callsâ€”what function is currently running and what functions are waiting to run after it finishes.

Think of it as a stack of plates:

You add a new plate (function call) to the top â€” this is called a push.

You remove the top plate (when a function finishes) â€” this is called a pop.*/


function greet() {
  console.log("Hello!");
  askName();
}

function askName() {
  console.log("Whatâ€™s your name?");
}

greet();
/*   Call Stack Steps:
greet() is called â†’ pushed onto the stack.

Inside greet(), askName() is called â†’ pushed onto the stack.

askName() finishes â†’ popped off.

greet() finishes â†’ popped off.

ðŸ“Œ The stack is now empty.*/
